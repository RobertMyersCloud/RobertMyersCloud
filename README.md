Cloud FinOps & Cost Governance  
MBA | BS Accounting | Budgeting, Variance Control, Decision Traceability

## Focus

I build **governance-first cloud cost controls** that leadership can actually review.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- FinOps cost governance
- IT financial management
- Cloud platform behavior (Azure-first)
- Audit-ready documentation and decision trails

This profile showcases **how cost decisions are made, explained, approved, and retained** — not just how dashboards look.

---

## What I work on

- Budget vs actual variance governance
- Cost ownership & allocation logic
- Forecast discipline and exception handling
- Executive-ready cost reporting
- Evidence retention for leadership, finance, and audit review

I intentionally avoid:
- “click-here” cloud tutorials  
- admin-level claims I can’t evidence  
- tool-first narratives without control logic

## Featured repository

### **FinOps Cost Governance Foundations**
A governance-first portfolio demonstrating how cloud spend is controlled as a **financial discipline**.

What it proves:
- Variance thresholds trigger action
- Decisions are logged and reviewable
- Evidence artifacts are retained and traceable
- Cost governance operates on a repeatable monthly rhythm

## Proof-driven approach

Every proof pack includes:
- executive summary (one-page)
- documented financial logic
- evidence index (traceability)
- sample tables and decision records
- explicit assumptions and scope boundaries

No screenshots or artifacts imply production authority or engineering control.
