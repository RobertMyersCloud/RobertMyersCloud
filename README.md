**Cloud Governance & Security Architecture**
MBA | BS Accounting | Budgeting, Variance Control, Decision Traceability

---

## Focus

I build **governance-first security and cost controls** that leadership can actually review, auditors can actually trace, and engineers can actually follow.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- Identity governance & administration (IGA)
- Supply chain risk management (SCRM)
- FinOps cost governance
- Cloud platform behavior (Azure-first)
- Audit-ready documentation and decision trails

This profile showcases how governance decisions are made, explained, approved, and retained — not just how dashboards look.

## What I work on

- Identity lifecycle automation (JML, RBAC, Conditional Access, PIM)
- Vendor risk scoring with deterministic justification layers
- Budget vs actual variance governance
- Cost ownership & allocation logic
- Forecast discipline and exception handling
- Executive-ready cost reporting
- Evidence retention for leadership, finance, and audit review

I intentionally avoid:

- "click-here" cloud tutorials
- admin-level claims I can't evidence
- tool-first narratives without control logic

## Program at a glance

| Pillar | Packs | Controls | Status |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| **Identity (IGA)** | 9 | 90 | Sealed |
| **Supply Chain (SCRM)** | 8 | 80 | Sealed |
| **FinOps** | 5 | 50 | Sealed |
| **Cloud Security** | 9 | 90 | Building |
| **Total** | **22+** | **220+** | **3 pillars operational** |

Every pack delivers 10 Expected-vs-Observed controls. Every control cites evidence. Every finding — including honest fails — is documented and tracked.

## Featured repositories

### [Enterprise Governance Proof Packs](https://github.com/RobertMyersCloud/Enterprise-Governance-Proof-Packs)

A governance-first portfolio demonstrating how cloud spend is controlled as a **financial discipline**.

What it proves:
- Variance thresholds trigger action
- Decisions are logged and reviewable
- Evidence artifacts are retained and traceable
- Cost governance operates on a repeatable monthly rhythm

### Identity & Access Governance (IGA)

9 packs covering the full identity lifecycle: joiner-mover-leaver automation, RBAC least privilege, conditional access, quarterly access reviews, PIM/JIT elevation, guest/vendor IAM, separation of duties, cloud permission management (CIEM), and identity threat detection.

### Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM)

8 packs covering the full vendor lifecycle: risk tiering and scoring, attestation validation, SBOM governance, vendor scorecards, incident response (52-second containment), Tier 2/3 traceability, SLA governance, and vendor offboarding.

## Proof-driven approach

Every proof pack includes:

- executive summary (one-page)
- documented financial or security logic
- evidence index (traceability)
- sample tables and decision records
- explicit assumptions and scope boundaries

No screenshots or artifacts imply production authority or engineering control.
