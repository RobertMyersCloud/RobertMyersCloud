## Purpose
Provide a one-page, executive-readable view of how cloud spend is governed as a **financial control domain**.

---

## Problem addressed
Cloud spend becomes difficult to manage when:
- budget ownership is unclear
- variance explanations are inconsistent
- forecasts are updated ad hoc
- decisions lack a retained evidence trail

---

## Governance model (summary)
A controlled monthly close:
1. Establish baseline budget
2. Review actuals and calculate variance
3. Route variance by thresholds
4. Update rolling forecast
5. Log decisions with rationale
6. Retain evidence for review

---

## Outputs produced
- Variance table with commentary references
- Forecast note with owner and rationale
- Allocation exception list
- Decision log entries linked to evidence IDs

---

## Review standard
- Sample and sanitized data only
- Evidence artifacts are linkable
- No implied production authority
