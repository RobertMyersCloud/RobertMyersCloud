## Purpose
Clarify the FinOps maturity level represented by this repository. This positioning is intentional and designed to:
- set accurate expectations for reviewers
- avoid over- or under-claiming scope
- align interviews to roles focused on governance, analysis, and financial discipline

---

## Maturity level represented
This repository reflects a **FinOps “Operate” maturity level**, with emphasis on:

- budget vs actual variance governance
- rolling forecast discipline
- cost allocation and exception handling
- decision logging with evidence traceability

The focus is on **controlling and explaining spend**, not optimizing infrastructure.

---

## What this framework is designed to do well
This framework is strongest in environments that need:

- predictable monthly cost review and close
- clear accountability for cloud spend
- defensible variance explanations for leadership and finance
- audit-ready evidence of decisions and approvals
- alignment between Finance, IT, and Cloud stakeholders

This maps well to roles such as:
- Cloud Cost Analyst
- IT Financial Analyst
- FinOps Analyst (governance / operate focus)
- TBM / Cost Governance Analyst

---

## What this framework intentionally does NOT cover (yet)
To avoid misrepresentation, this repository does **not** claim maturity in:

- infrastructure-level optimization (rightsizing, autoscaling)
- engineering-led performance tuning
- advanced automation or policy enforcement
- real-time cost optimization workflows
- savings attribution metrics or ROI claims

These areas are typically addressed at later FinOps maturity stages or by engineering-led teams.

---

## How this could evolve (without refactoring)
This framework is designed to scale forward without changing its core structure.

Potential future extensions could include:
- forecast accuracy tracking over time
- allocation-driven showback / chargeback models
- optimization recommendations fed into the decision log
- cross-cloud normalization (conceptual, not tool-specific)

These would build on the **same governance and evidence foundation** already established.

---

## Positioning summary
This repository represents a **deliberate, defensible FinOps operating baseline**.

It demonstrates the ability to:
- run a disciplined monthly FinOps close
- explain cloud spend in financial terms
- support leadership decisions with evidence
- operate safely within governance and audit expectations

It does not attempt to shortcut maturity by over-claiming technical execution.
