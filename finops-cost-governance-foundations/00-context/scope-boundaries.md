## Purpose
Define scope boundaries to keep this repository recruiter-safe and audit-safe. This repo demonstrates **FinOps / cloud cost governance** as a financial control domain and avoids implying:
- production tenant access
- engineering authority
- on-call operational responsibility

---

## Included (in scope)
This repository focuses on governance, analysis, controls, and reporting, including:

- Budget baselines and variance governance (monitor / investigate / escalate)
- Rolling forecast discipline and forecast-change rationale
- Cost allocation logic and exception handling (including Unallocated)
- Executive-ready reporting artifacts and decision support
- Evidence indexing and traceability (EV / VC reference discipline)
- Repeatable operating rhythms (monthly close approach)
- Documentation standards suitable for leadership and audit review

---

## Excluded (out of scope)
This repository intentionally avoids:

- Deep cloud configuration walkthroughs (portal/CLI step-by-step)
- Infrastructure engineering work (rightsizing, autoscaling, performance tuning)
- Security tooling deep dives (SIEM/SOAR/EDR operations)
- Identity protocol detail (SAML/OAuth/OIDC/MFA implementation)
- On-call claims, incident response operations, or production support promises
- Cost savings claims, ROI claims, or metrics not directly evidenced in-repo

---

## Evidence and data boundaries
- Sample / sanitized tables are used to demonstrate governance methodology.
- No files represent employer billing exports or production tenant screenshots unless explicitly stated and properly sanitized.
- Any future screenshots must be sanitized and indexed in the evidence register.
