## Purpose
Provide a one-page, executive-readable view of how cloud spend is governed as a **financial control domain** through budget baselines, variance thresholds, rolling forecast updates, and evidence-backed decision logging.

---

## Problem this solves
Cloud spend becomes difficult to manage when:
- budget ownership is unclear
- variance explanations are inconsistent
- forecasts are updated ad hoc
- decisions lack a retained evidence trail

This proof pack establishes a repeatable review model that produces traceable outputs suitable for leadership and audit review.

---

## Governance approach (summary)
The operating model is a controlled monthly rhythm:

1. Establish baseline budget and cost ownership for the period
2. Review actual spend and calculate variance
3. Route variance by thresholds (monitor / investigate / escalate)
4. Update rolling forecast when triggers are met
5. Log the decision (approve / re-allocate / reduce / defer) with rationale
6. Retain evidence and reference it in an index

**Decision standard:** Each investigate/escalate item ends with an owner, a decision (approve / re-allocate / reduce / defer), and an evidence reference ID.

---

## What a reviewer gets (outputs)
A consistent "monthly close" package:
- variance table with commentary references
- forecast note (date, owner, rationale)
- allocation exception list (unallocated spend flagged)
- decision log entries linked to evidence IDs

---

## Control standards (audit-safe)
- No implied production access or employer billing data
- Sample/sanitized tables only
- Evidence artifacts are linkable and indexed
- Framework emphasizes governance behavior, not platform administration
